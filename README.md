# Domain-Driven Design (DDD)

## Overview

This repository serves as a guide and reference for implementing Domain-Driven Design (DDD) principles in software development. DDD is an approach that focuses on understanding and modeling the problem domain to create software systems that reflect real-world complexities and business needs.

## What is Domain-Driven Design?

Domain-Driven Design is a set of principles, patterns, and practices that aim to bridge the gap between the problem domain (the subject area the software addresses) and the software model. Key concepts include:

- **Ubiquitous Language**: Establishing a shared language between domain experts and developers to accurately represent the domain within the codebase.
  
- **Bounded Contexts**: Defining clear boundaries around specific areas of the domain to manage complexity and encapsulate domain logic.
  
- **Entities and Value Objects**: Representing domain concepts using entities (objects with unique identities) and value objects (immutable objects without identity).
  
- **Aggregates and Aggregate Roots**: Organizing related entities and enforcing consistency boundaries within a domain model.

## Repository Structure

- **/src**: Contains the source code demonstrating DDD principles.
  
- **/docs**: Provides supplementary documentation, articles, and resources related to DDD.

## Getting Started

To explore the examples and understand the implementation of DDD:

1. Clone this repository:

    ```bash
    git clone <repository_url>
    ```

2. Navigate to the relevant directories within `/src` to explore specific DDD patterns and concepts.

## Contributing

Contributions to enhance and expand the examples, provide additional documentation, or correct any issues are welcome. Please follow the guidelines outlined in `CONTRIBUTING.md` before submitting a pull request.
